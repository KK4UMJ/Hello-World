# Hello-World
Code For Free initial GIT

ARRL member KK4UMJ here, beginning to learn about web development coding.
My goal is to understand enough to be a good partner for professional developers and coders. 
I want to understand how/why they are successful or unsuccessful with requests, and how to better ask questions
to find sollutions.
